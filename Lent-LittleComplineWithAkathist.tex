and from all the multitude of evils which we mortals suffer
for the number of our sins.

\choralresponse{./Z-Responses/AkathistHymnBasil/MostHolyTheotokosSaveUs.ly}

Thou hast appeared to enlighten us and be our confirmation,
wherefore we cry aloud to thee:
Hail, O unsetting star which didst introduce into the world the mighty Sun;
Hail, pure maiden, who didst open up fast-closed Eden;
Hail, fiery pillar, which doth lead man’s nature to the life above.

\choralresponse{./Z-Responses/AkathistHymnBasil/MostHolyTheotokosSaveUs.ly}

Let us stand with reverence in the house of our God, and let us cry aloud:
Hail, mistress of the world;
Hail, Mary, Lady of us all;

Hail, O vessel, which didst receive into thyself the myrrh
which was never before outpoured.

\choralresponse{./Z-Responses/AkathistHymnBasil/GlorytoTheFSandHS.ly}

Hail, O Ever-virgin, thou dove who didst bring forth Him Who is merciful.
Hail, boast of all the righteous saints and crown of those who strive.
Hail, ornament divine of all the just, and of us the faithful,
our salvation as well.

\choralresponse{./Z-Responses/AkathistHymnBasil/BothNowAndEver.ly}

Spare, O God, Thine inheritance, and overlook now all our sins.
For as intercessor in Thy sight, O Christ,
there stands before Thee she that on earth conceived Thee without seed,
when in Thy Great Mercy
Thou hast willed to be shaped in a form that was not Thine own.
