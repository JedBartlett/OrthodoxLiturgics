  The sun knoweth his going down. Thou appointedst the darkness, and there was the night.
  How magnified are Thy works, O Lord! In wisdom hast Thou made them all.

\begin{priest}
  \item \small{\instruction{(Quietly)} O Lord our God,
    Thou upholdest all things by Thy pure and perfect hand,
    Thou art patient with us all and mournest over our wickedness:
    remember Thy compassions and Thy mercy.
    Visit us with Thy goodness; and grant us to complete the present day,
    avoiding the diverse plots of the evil one; and preserve our lives free from attack,
    through the grace of Thine all-holy Spirit.
    Through the mercy and love toward mankind of Thine only-begotten Son,
    with Whom Thou art blessed, together with Thine all-holy and good and life-giving Spirit:
    now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.}
  \item \small{\instruction{(Quietly)} O great and wonderful God,
    with Thine inexpressible wisdom, and Thine abundant providence Thou administerest all things.
    Thou hast bestowed on us good things on earth;
    Thou hast given us a pledge of the promised kingdom through the good things
    already bestowed on us;
    and Thou hast made us to flee from all evil during that part of this day which is past:
    Grant us also to complete this day without blame before Thy holy glory, and to glorify Thee,
    our God, Who art the only good One, and Lover of mankind.
    For Thou art our God, and unto Thee we ascribe glory:
    to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:
    now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.}
  \item \small{\instruction{(Quietly)} O great and most high God,
    Thou alone hast immortality and dwellest in unapproachable light.
    Thou hast made all creation in wisdom. Thou hast separated the light from
    the darkness. Thou hast made the sun to rule the day, the moon and the stars to rule the night.
    Thou hast made us sinners at this present hour worthy to come before Thy face with thanksgiving
    and to offer to Thee our evening praises. Do Thou Thyself, O Lord, Lover of mankind,
    direct our prayer as incense before Thee, and accept it as a fragrant offering.
    Grant us to pass the present evening and the coming night in peace.
    Clothe us with the armor of light.
    Deliver us from the terror of the night and from the pestilence that stalks in the darkness.
    Grant us sleep, which Thou hast appointed for the alleviation of our weakness,
    free from every imagination of the devil. Yea, O Master of all,
    Bestower of good things, may we, being moved toward repentance on our beds, remember Thy
    Name in the night, that, illuminated by meditation on Thy commandments, we may rise up in
    joyfulness of soul to glorify Thy goodness, offering up prayers,
    and supplications to Thy tender love for our sins and for those of all Thy people,
    whom Thou visitest in mercy, through the intercessions of the holy Theotokos.
    For Thou art a good God and lovest mankind, and unto thee
    we ascribe glory: to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,
    now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.}
