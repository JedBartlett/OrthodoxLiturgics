O God, my God, unto Thee I rise early at dawn. My soul hath thirsted for Thee;
how often hath my flesh longed after Thee in a land
barren and untrodden and unwatered.
So in the sanctuary have I appeared before Thee to see Thy power and Thy glory.
For Thy mercy is better than lives;
my lips shall praise Thee.
So shall I bless Thee in my life,
and in Thy name will I lift up my hands.
As with marrow and fatness let my soul be filled,
and with lips rejoicing shall my mouth praise Thee.
If I remembered Thee on my bed,
at the dawn I meditated on Thee.
For Thou art become my helper;
in the shelter of Thy wings will I rejoice.
My soul hath cleaved after Thee;
Thy right hand hath been quick to help me.
But as for these, in vain have they sought after my soul;
they shall go into the nethermost parts of the earth,
they shall be surrendered unto the edge of the sword;
portions for foxes shall they be.
But the king shall be glad in God,
everyone shall be praised that sweareth by Him;
for the mouth of them is stopped that speak unjust things.
