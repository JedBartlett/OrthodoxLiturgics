O Lord God of my salvation, by day have I cried and by night before Thee.
Let my prayer come before Thee, bow down Thine ear unto my supplication,
for filled with evils is my soul, and my life unto Hades hath drawn nigh.
I am counted with them that go down into the pit;
I am become as a man without help, free among the dead,
like the bodies of the slain that sleep in the grave,
whom Thou rememberest no more, and they are cut off from Thy hand.
They laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness and in the shadow of death.
Against me is Thine anger made strong,
and all Thy billows hast Thou brought upon me.
Thou hast removed my friends afar from me;
they have made me an abomination unto themselves.
I have been delivered up, and have not come forth;
mine eyes are grown weak from poverty.
I have cried unto Thee, O Lord, the whole day long;
I have stretched out my hands unto Thee.
Nay, for the dead wilt Thou work wonders?
Or shall physicians raise them up that they may give thanks unto Thee?
Nay, shall any in the grave tell of Thy mercy,
and of Thy truth in that destruction?
Nay, shall Thy wonders be known in that darkness,
and Thy righteousness in that land that is forgotten?
But as for me, unto Thee, O Lord, have I cried;
and in the morning shall my prayer come before Thee.
Wherefore, O Lord,
dost Thou cast off my soul and turnest Thy face away from me?
A poor man am I, and in troubles from my youth;
yea, having been exalted, I was humbled and brought to distress.
Thy furies have passed upon me, and Thy terrors have sorely troubled me.
They came round about me like water,
all the day long they compassed me about together.
Thou hast removed afar from me friend and neighbor,
and mine acquaintances because of my misery.
