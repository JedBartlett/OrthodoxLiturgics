O Lord, why are they multiplied that afflict me?
Many rise up against me. Many say unto my soul:
There is no salvation for him in his God.
But Thou, O Lord, art my helper, my glory,
and the lifter up of my head.
I cried unto the Lord with my voice,
and He heard me out of His holy mountain.
I laid me down and slept;
I awoke, for the Lord will help me.
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people
that set themselves against me round about.
Arise, O Lord, save me, O my God,
for Thou hast smitten all who without cause are mine enemies;
the teeth of sinners hast Thou broken.
Salvation is of the Lord,
and Thy blessing is upon Thy people.
