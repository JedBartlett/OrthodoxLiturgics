				O Theotokos, thou art the true vine who didst bud forth for us the Fruit of life.  Implore thou him, we beseech thee, O Lady, together with the apostles and all the saints, that he will have mercy on our souls.

				Blessed is the Lord God, blessed is the Lord day by day; the God of our salvation shall prosper us along the way.  Our God is the God of salvation.

				O Master God, Almighty Father, O Lord, the only-begotten Son Jesus Christ, and O Holy Spirit, one Godhead and one Power: Have mercy on me a sinner; and by the judgments which thou hast established, save me, thine unworthy servant, for thou art blessed unto ages of ages.  Amen.}

				Seeing that we have no boldness, because of the multitude of our sins, do thou, O Virgin Theotokos, fervently entreat him who was born of thee; for the prayer of a mother availeth much to the good will of the Master. Despise not the supplications of sinners, O all-revered one; for merciful and mighty to save is he who graciously deigned to suffer for us.

				Let thy compassions quickly go before us, O Lord, for we are become exceedingly poor.  Help us, O God our Saviour, for the sake of the glory of thy name; O Lord, deliver us, and be gracious unto our sins, for thy name's sake.

		\subsection{Prayer of Saint Basil the Great}

			\reader
				O God and Lord of hosts and Maker of all things created, who through the tender-hearted compassion of thine incomparable mercy didst send down thine only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, for the salvation of our race, and by his precious cross didst destroy the handwriting of our sins and didst thereby triumph over the origin and powers of darkness: Do thou, the same Lord, who lovest mankind, receive also these thanksgivings and fervent prayers of us sinners.  And deliver us from every harmful and gloomy transgression and from all enemies, both visible and invisible, who seek after us to destroy us.  Nail our flesh with the fear of thee, and incline not our hearts to words or thoughts of wickedness; but wound our souls with the love of thee, that looking ever unto thee and guided by thee in the light, beholding thee, the Light ineffable and everlasting, we may ascribe unto thee ceaseless confession and thanksgiving unto the unoriginate Father, together with Thine only-begotten Son, and thine all-holy and good and life-giving Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages.  Amen.}
