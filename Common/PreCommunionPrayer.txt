I believe, O Lord and I confess
that Thou art truly the Christ,
the Son of the living God,
who didst come into the world to save sinners,
of whom I am chief.
And I believe that this is truly Thine own immaculate Body,
and that this is truly Thine own precious Blood.
Wherefore I pray Thee,
have mercy upon me and forgive my transgressions
both voluntary and involuntary,
of word and of deed,
of knowledge and of ignorance;
and make me worthy to partake without condemnation
of Thine immaculate Mysteries,
unto remission of my sins and unto life everlasting. Amen.

Of Thy Mystic Supper, O Son of God,
accept me today as a communicant:
for I will not speak of Thy Mystery to Thine enemies,
neither will I give Thee a kiss as did Judas;
but like the thief will I confess Thee:
Remember me, O Lord, in Thy kingdom.

Not unto judgment nor unto condemnation
be my partaking of Thy Holy Mysteries, O Lord,
but unto the healing of soul and body.
