\item O Lord and Master of my life,
    take from me the spirit of sloth, meddling, lust of power and idle talk.
    \instruction{prostration}
\item But give rather the spirit of chastity, humility,
    patience and love to thy servant.
    \instruction{prostration}
\item Yea, O Lord and King, grant me to see my own sins and not to judge my brother,
    for Thou art blessed unto ages of ages, Amen.
    \instruction{prostration}
