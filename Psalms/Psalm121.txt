 I was glad because of them that said unto me: Let us go into the house of the Lord. Our
feet have stood in thy courts, O Jerusalem. Jerusalem is built as a city which its dwellers share in
concord. For there the tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord, as a testimony for Israel, to give thanks
to the Name of the Lord. For there are set thrones unto judgment, thrones over the house of David.
Ask now for the things which are for the peace of Jerusalem, and for the prosperity of them that
love thee. Let peace be now in thy strength, and prosperity in thy palaces. For the sake of my
brethren and my neighbors, I spake peace concerning thee. Because of the house of the Lord our
God, I have sought good things for thee.
