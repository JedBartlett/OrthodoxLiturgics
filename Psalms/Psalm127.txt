Blessed are all they that fear the Lord, that walk in His ways. Thou shalt eat the fruit of
thy labors; blessed art thou, and well shall it be with thee. Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine on
the sides of thy house, thy sons like young olive trees round about thy table. Behold, so shall the
man be blessed that feareth the Lord. The Lord bless thee out of Sion, and mayest thou see the
good things of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. And mayest thou see thy childrenâ€™s children;
peace be upon Israel.
