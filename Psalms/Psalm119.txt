Unto the Lord in mine affliction have I cried, and He heard me. O Lord, deliver my soul
from unrighteous lips and from a crafty tongue. What shall be given unto thee and what shall be
added unto thee for thy crafty tongue? The arrows of the mighty one, sharpened with coals of the
desert. Woe is me, for my sojourning is prolonged; I have tented with the tentings of Kedar; my
soul hath long been a sojourner. With them that hate peace I was peaceable; when I spake unto
them, they warred against me without a cause.
