Thy priests shall be clothed with righteousness, and Thy righteous shall rejoice. For the
sake of David Thy servant, turn not Thy face away from Thine anointed one. The Lord hath sworn
in truth unto David, and He will not annul it: of the fruit of thy loins will I set upon thy throne. If
thy sons keep My covenant and these testimonies which I will teach them, their sons also shall sit
forever on thy throne. For the Lord hath elected Sion, He hath chosen her to be a habitation for
Himself. This is My rest forever and ever; here will I dwell, for I have chosen her. Blessing, I will
bless her pursuit; her beggars will I satisfy with bread. Her priests will I clothe with salvation, and
her saints with rejoicing shall rejoice. There will I make to spring forth a horn for David, I have
prepared a lamp for My Christ. His enemies will I clothe with shame, but upon Him shall My
sanctification flourish.
