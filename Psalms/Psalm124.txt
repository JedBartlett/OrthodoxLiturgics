They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Sion; he that dwelleth at Jerusalem, nevermore shall
he be shaken. Mountains are round about her, and the Lord is round about His people from
henceforth and forevermore. For the Lord will not permit the rod of sinners to be upon the lot of
the righteous, lest the righteous stretch forth their hands unto iniquities. Do good, O Lord, unto
them that are good and unto the upright of heart. But them that turn aside unto crooked ways shall
the Lord lead away with the workers of iniquity; peace be upon Israel.
