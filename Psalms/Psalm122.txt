Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, unto Thee that dwellest in heaven. Behold, as the eyes
of servants look unto the hands of their masters, as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of
her mistress, so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, until He take pity on us. Have mercy on us,
O Lord, have mercy on us, for greatly are we filled with abasement. Greatly hath our soul been filled
therewith; let reproach come upon them that prosper, and abasement on the proud.
