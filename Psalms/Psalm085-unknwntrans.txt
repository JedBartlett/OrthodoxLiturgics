Bow down Thine ear, O Lord, and hearken unto me, for poor and needy am I.
Preserve my soul, for I am holy;
save Thy servant, O my God, that hopeth in Thee.
Have mercy on me, O Lord, for unto Thee will I cry all the day long;
make glad the soul of Thy servant, for unto Thee have I lifted up my soul.
For Thou, O Lord, art good and gentle,
and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon Thee.
Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer,
and attend unto the voice of my supplication.
In the day of mine affliction have I cried unto Thee, for Thou hast heard me.
There is none like unto Thee among the gods, O Lord,
nor are there any works like unto Thy works.
All the nations whom Thou hast made shall come and shall worship before Thee,
O Lord, and shall glorify Thy name.
For Thou art great and workest wonders; Thou alone art God.
Guide me, O Lord, in Thy way, and I will walk in Thy truth;
let my heart rejoice that I
may fear Thy name.
I will confess Thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart,
and I will glorify Thy name for ever.
For great is Thy mercy upon me,
and Thou hast delivered my soul from the nethermost hades.
O God, transgressors have risen up against me,
and the assembly of the mighty hath
sought after my soul, and they have not set Thee before them.
But Thou, O Lord my God, art compassionate and merciful,
long-suffering and plenteous in mercy, and true.
Look upon me and have mercy upon me;
give Thy strength unto Thy servant, and save the son of Thy handmaiden.
Work in me a sign unto good,
and let them that hate me behold and be put to shame;
for Thou, O Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me.
