O Lord, hear my prayer, give ear unto my supplication in Thy truth;
hearken unto me in Thy righteousness.
And enter not into judgment with Thy servant,
for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.
For the enemy hath persecuted my soul;
he hath humbled my life down to the earth.
He hath sat me in darkness as those that have been long dead,
and my spirit within me is become despondent;
within me my heart is troubled.
I remembered days of old, I meditated on all Thy works,
I pondered on the creations of Thy hands.
I stretched forth my hands unto Thee;
my soul thirsteth after Thee like a waterless land.
Quickly hear me, O Lord;
my spirit hath fainted away.
Turn not Thy face away from me,
lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
Cause me to hear Thy mercy in the morning;
for in Thee have I put my hope.
Cause me to know, O Lord, the way wherein I should walk;
for unto Thee have I lifted up my soul.
Rescue me from mine enemies, O Lord;
unto Thee have I fled for refuge.
Teach me to do Thy will, for Thou art my God.
Thy good Spirit shall lead me in the land of uprightness;
for Thy nameâ€™s sake, O Lord, shalt Thou quicken me.
In Thy righteousness shalt Thou bring my soul out of affliction,
and in Thy mercy shalt Thou utterly destroy mine enemies.
And Thou shalt cut off all them that afflict my soul, for I am Thy servant.
