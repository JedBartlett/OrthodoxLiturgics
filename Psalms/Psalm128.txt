Many a time have they warred against me from my youth, let Israel now say, many a time
have they warred against me from my youth, and yet they have not prevailed against me. The
sinners wrought upon my back, they lengthened out their iniquity. The Lord is righteous; He hath
cut asunder the necks of sinners. Let them be put to shame and turned back, all they that hate Sion.
Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which before it is plucked up is withered away.
Wherefore the reaper filleth not his hand, nor he that gathereth sheaves his bosom. Nor have they
that passed by said: The blessing of the Lord come upon you; we have blessed you in the Name of
the Lord.
