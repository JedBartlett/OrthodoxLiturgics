I have lifted up mine eyes to the mountains, from whence cometh my help. My help
cometh from the Lord, Who hath made heaven and the earth. Give not thy foot unto moving, and
may He not slumber that keepeth thee. Behold, He shall not slumber nor shall He sleep, He that
keepeth Israel. The Lord shall keep thee; the Lord is thy shelter at thy right hand. The sun shall not
burn thee by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord shall keep thee from all evil; the Lord shall
guard thy soul. The Lord shall keep thy coming in and thy going out, from henceforth and
forevermore.
