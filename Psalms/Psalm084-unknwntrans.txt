Thou hast been gracious, O Lord, unto Thy land;
Thou hast turned back the captivity of Jacob.
Thou hast forgiven the iniquities of Thy people,
Thou hast covered all their sins.
Thou hast made all Thy wrath to cease,
Thou hast turned back from the wrath of Thine anger.
Turn us back, O God of our salvation, and turn away Thine anger from us.
Wilt Thou be wroth with us unto the ages? Or wilt Thou draw out Thy wrath from
generation to generation?
O God, Thou wilt turn and quicken us, and Thy people shall be glad in Thee.
Show us, O Lord, Thy mercy, and Thy salvation do Thou give unto us.
I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me;
for He will speak peace to His people
and to His saints and to them that turn their heart unto Him.
Surely nigh unto them that fear Him is His salvation,
that glory may dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth are met together,
righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
Truth is sprung up out of the earth,
and righteousness hath looked down from heaven.
Yea, for the Lord will give goodness, and our land shall yield her fruit.
Righteousness shall go before Him and shall set His footsteps in the way.
