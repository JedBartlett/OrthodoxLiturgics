Had it not been that the Lord was with us, let Israel now say, had it not been that the Lord
was with us, when men rose up against us, then had they swallowed us up alive. When their wrath
raged against us, then had the water overwhelmed us. Our soul hath passed through a torrent; then
had our soul passed through the water that is irresistible. Blessed be the Lord Who hath not given
us to be a prey to their teeth. Our soul like a sparrow was delivered out of the snare of the hunters.
The snare is broken, and we are delivered. Our help is in the Name of the Lord, Who hath made
heaven and the earth.
