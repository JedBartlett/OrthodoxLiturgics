Remember, O Lord, David and all his meekness. How he made an oath unto the Lord, and
vowed unto the God of Jacob: I shall not go into the dwelling of my house, I shall not ascend upon
the bed of my couch, I shall not give sleep to mine eyes, nor slumber to mine eyelids, nor rest to
my temples, until I find a place for the Lord, a habitation for the God of Jacob. Lo, we have heard
of it in Ephratha, we have found it in the plains of the wood. Let us go forth into His tabernacles,
let us worship at the place where His feet have stood. Arise, O Lord, into Thy rest, Thou and the
ark of Thy holiness.
