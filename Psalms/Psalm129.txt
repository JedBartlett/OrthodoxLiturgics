Out of the depths have I cried unto Thee, O Lord; Lord hear my voice. Let Thine ears be attentive
to the voice of my supplication. If Thou, O Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
stand? For with Thee there is forgiveness, that Thou mayest be feared. Because of Thy Name have
I waited for Thee, O Lord; my soul hath waited upon Thy word, my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch let Israel trust in the Lord. For with
the Lord there is mercy and with Him is abundant redemption, and He will deliver Israel from all
his iniquities.
