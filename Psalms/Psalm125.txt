When the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion, we became as men that are comforted.
Then was our mouth filled with joy, and our tongue with rejoicing. Then shall they say among the
nations: The Lord hath done great things unto them. The Lord hath done great things among us,
and we are become glad. Turn again, O Lord, our captivity, like streams in the south. They that
sow with tears shall reap with rejoicing. In their going they went, and they wept as they cast their
seeds. But in their coming shall they come with rejoicing, bearing their sheaves.
