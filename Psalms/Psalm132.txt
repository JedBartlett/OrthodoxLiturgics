Behold now, what is so good or so joyous as for brethren to dwell together in unity? It is
like the oil of myrrh upon the head, which runneth down upon the beard, upon the beard of Aaron,
which runneth down to the fringe of his raiment. It is like the dew of Aermon, which cometh down
upon the mountains of Sion. For there the Lord commanded the blessing, life forevermore.
