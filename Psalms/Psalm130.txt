O Lord, my heart is not exalted, nor are mine eyes become lofty. Nor have I walked in
things too great or too marvelous for me. If I were not humble-minded but exalted my soul, as one
weaned from his mother, so wouldst Thou requite my soul. Let Israel hope in the Lord, from
henceforth and forevermore.
