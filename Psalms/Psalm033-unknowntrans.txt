I will bless the Lord at all times,
His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
In the Lord shall my soul be praised;
let the meek hear and be glad.
O magnify the Lord with me,
and let us exalt His name together.
I sought the Lord, and He heard me,
and delivered me from all my tribulations.
Come unto Him, and be enlightened,
and your faces shall not be ashamed.
This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him,
and saved him out of all his tribulations.
The angel of the Lord will encamp round about them that fear Him,
and will deliver them.
O taste and see that the Lord is good;
blessed is the man that hopeth in Him.
O fear the Lord, all ye His saints;
for there is no want to them that fear Him.
Rich men have turned poor and gone hungry;
but they that seek the Lord shall not be deprived of any good thing.
Come ye children, hearken unto me;
I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
What man is there that desireth life,
who loveth to see good days?
Keep thy tongue from evil,
and thy lips from speaking guile.
Turn away from evil, and do good;
seek peace, and pursue it.
The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous,
and His ears are opened unto their supplication.
The face of the Lord is against them that do evil,
utterly to destroy the remembrance of them from the earth.
The righteous cried, and the Lord heard them,
and He delivered them out of all their tribulations.
The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart,
and He will save the humble of spirit.
Many are the tribulations of the righteous,
and the Lord shall deliver them out of them all.
The Lord keepeth all their bones,
not one of them shall be broken.
The death of sinners is evil,
and they that hate the righteous shall do wrong.
The Lord will redeem the souls of His servants,
and none of them will do wrong that hope in Him.
