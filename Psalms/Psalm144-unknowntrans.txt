I will exalt Thee, O my God, my king,
and I will bless Thy name for ever,
yea, for ever and ever.
Every day will I bless Thee,
and I will praise Thy name for ever,
yea, for ever and ever.
Great is the Lord and exceedingly to be praised,
and of His greatness there is no end.
Generation and generation shall praise Thy works,
and Thy power shall they declare.
Of the majesty of the glory of Thy holiness shall they speak,
and they shall tell of Thy wonders.
And the power of Thine awesome deeds shall they relate,
and they shall tell of Thy majesty.
The memory of the multitude of Thy goodness shall they pour forth,
and in Thy righteousness shall they rejoice.
Compassionate and merciful is the Lord,
long-suffering and plenteous in mercy.
The Lord is good to all,
and His compassions are over all His works.
Let all Thy works, O Lord, give praise to Thee,
and let Thy righteous ones bless Thee.
Of the glory of Thy kingdom shall they speak,
and shall tell of Thy dominion,
To make Thy dominion known to the sons of men,
and the glory of the majesty of Thy kingdom.
Thy kingdom is the kingdom of all the ages,
and Thy sovereignty is in every generation and generation.
Faithful is the Lord in all His words,
and holy in all His works.
The Lord upholdeth all that are falling,
and setteth up all that are broken down.
The eyes of all look to Thee with hope,
and Thou gavest them their food in due season.
Thou openest Thy hand
and fillest every living thing with Thy favour.
Righteous is the Lord in all His ways,
and holy in all His works.
The Lord is nigh unto all that call upon Him,
to all that call on Him in truth.
The will of them that fear Him shall He do,
and their supplication shall He hear, and He shall save them.
The Lord preserveth all that love Him,
but all the sinners shall He utterly destroy.
My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord,
and let all flesh bless His holy name, for ever,
yea, for ever and ever.
