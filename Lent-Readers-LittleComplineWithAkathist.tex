Spare, O God, Thine inheritance, and overlook now all our sins.
For as intercessor in Thy sight, O Christ,
there stands before Thee she that on earth conceived Thee without seed,
when in Thy Great Mercy
Thou hast willed to be shaped in a form that was not Thine own.

\instruction{Read in front of the icon of the Virgin on the Iconostasis}

O Lady, Bride of God, spotless, blameless, pure and immaculate Virgin,
thou who without corruption, by thy glorious birth-giving,
has united God the Word to man and joined the fallen nature of our race to heavenly things;
who alone art the hope of the hopeless, the help of those who do battle;
the ready help of those who flee unto thee and the refuge of all Christians:
Despise me not, an accursed sinner,
though I have rendered myself unworthy by my shameful thoughts, words and deeds,
and through indolence have become a slave to the pleasures of life;
but as the Mother of God, who lovest mankind, mercifully have compassion upon me,
a sinner and a prodigal, and receive my prayer,
though it be offered unto thee by unworthy lips;
and using Thy boldness as a mother, importune Thy Son, our Lord and Master,
that He may open to me also the tender compassions of His goodness
so as to overlook my numberless transgressions and turn me to repentance
and show me forth as a zealous doer of His commandments.
And because thou art merciful, compassionate and benevolent,
be thou ever near me in this present life as an ardent help and protection,
defending me from the assaults of adversaries and leading me to salvation.
And at the time of my departure from this life, care for my miserable soul,
and drive far from it the dark visions of evil demons; and in the fearful Day of Judgment,
deliver me from eternal punishment,
and present me as an inheritor of the ineffable glory of Thy Son, our God.
May this be my lot, O Lady, most holy Theotokos,
through thy mediation and help,
through the grace and love toward mankind of thine only-begotten Son,
our Lord, and God, and Savior, Jesus Christ,
to Whom are due all glory, honor and worship,
with his unoriginate Father, and His All-Holy, and good, and life-giving Spirit,
now and ever, and unto ages of ages.

And grant unto us, O Master, when we depart to sleep, repose of body and soul;
and protect us from the murky sleep of sin and from all the dark pleasures of the night.
Calm the impulses of passions,
and quench the fiery darts of evil which are craftily thrown against us;
check the turbulence of our flesh, and still all earthly and material thoughts.
And grant us, O God, a watchful mind, a prudent reason, a vigilant heart,
a tranquil sleep free from all the fantasies of Satan.
Raise us up again at the time of prayer strengthened in Thy commandments,
holding steadfastly within us the remembrance of Thy judgments.
Grant us grace to glorify Thee all through the night that we may praise,
and bless, and glorify Thine all-honorable and majestic Name,
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
now and ever, and unto ages of ages.
